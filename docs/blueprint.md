# **App Name**: DimxTube Reimagined

## Core Features:

- Responsive Home Page: Display a grid of video thumbnails with titles, channel names, view counts, and upload dates that adjusts based on screen size, with dummy video data. Includes category bar and sticky header.
- Video Watch Page: Show a placeholder video player, video title, channel info, subscription button, view count, and like/dislike/share buttons, along with a dummy comment section.
- Shorts Page: Implement a vertical scrolling interface similar to YouTube Shorts, with video controls (like, comment, share) on the right side.
- Subscriptions Page: Display a horizontal list of subscribed channels at the top and a grid of recent videos from those channels below.
- Library Page: Mock up a library page to show dummy watch history, playlists, and saved videos.
- Adaptive Navigation: Use a left sidebar for desktop/tablet and a bottom navigation bar for mobile, adapting automatically based on screen size.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: YouTube Red (#FF0000) to maintain brand recognition.
- Background color: Light gray (#F9F9F9) for light mode; Dark gray (#121212) for dark mode, offering a high-contrast backdrop that reduces eye strain and improves content visibility in each mode.
- Accent color: A slightly desaturated blue (#3EA6FF) analogous to YouTube Red, used for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Roboto' sans-serif, for a modern and readable style. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use Material Icons for a consistent and recognizable visual language throughout the app.
- Implement a responsive grid layout with breakpoints for desktop (≥1200px), tablet (≥768px and <1200px), and mobile (<768px).
- Add subtle hover effects on video thumbnails, a sticky navbar with a light shadow on scroll, and a collapsing sidebar animation to improve the user experience.
